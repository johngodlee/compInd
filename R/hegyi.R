#' Hegyi index - Hegyi 1974
#'
#' @param dbh vector of DBH (diameter at breast height) measurements of 
#'     competitor trees
#' @param dist vector of distances from focal tree to competitor trees
#' @param focal_dbh DBH of focal tree
#'
#' @return atomic vector of competition index for focal tree
#' 
#' @details A spatially explicit competition index which takes into account DBH
#' and distance of competitor trees. The iterative Hegyi index is a variant 
#' which picks competitors based on minimum distance of neighbouring trees 
#' within arc zones around the focal tree.
