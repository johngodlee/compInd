\title{Alemdag's (1978) tree competition index}
\usage{
alemdag(dbh, dist, focal_dbh)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbh}{vector of DBH (diameter at breast height) measurements of competitor trees}

\item{dist}{vector of distances from focal tree to competitor trees}

\item{focal_dbh}{DBH of focal tree}
}
\value{
atomic vector of competition index for focal tree
}
\description{
Alemdag's (1978) tree competition index
}
\details{
A spatially explicit competition index originally used in white
spruce plantations. The value of this function increases when competitor
trees are closer to the focal tree, or when competitor trees are larger.
Alemdag's competition index is defined by the following equation:
\deqn{\sum{n}{j\neq{}i}(\pi[(l_{ij}d_{i})/(d_{i} + d_{j})]^2 (d_{j} / l_{ij}) / \sum(d_{j} / l_{ij}))}
where \eqn{l_{ij}} is the distance between focal tree \eqn{i} and tree
\eqn{j}, \eqn{d_{i}} is the diameter (DBH) of focal tree \eqn{i}.
