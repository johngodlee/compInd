\title{Forest matrix crowding index - Seydack et al. 2011}
\usage{
crowdInd(dbh, dbh_min = 10, dbh_max = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbh}{vector of DBH (diameter at breast height) measurements of competitor trees}

\item{dbh_min}{minimum DBH threshold considered}

\item{dbh_max}{maximum DBH threshold considered}
}
\value{
atomic vector of competition index for focal tree
}
\description{
Forest matrix crowding index - Seydack et al. 2011
}
\details{
A simple competition index which returns the sum of DBH values of
all competitor trees within user-defined DBH thresholds. Armin et al.
(2011) use a minimum threshold of 10 cm DBH and a maximum threshold of
30 cm DBH.
