\title{Hegyi index - Hegyi 1974}
\usage{
hegyi(dbh, dist, focal_dbh)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbh}{vector of DBH (diameter at breast height) measurements of
competitor trees}

\item{dist}{vector of distances from focal tree to competitor trees}

\item{focal_dbh}{DBH of focal tree}
}
\value{
value of competition index for focal tree
}
\description{
Hegyi index - Hegyi 1974
}
\details{
A spatially explicit competition index which takes into account DBH
and distance of competitor trees. The iterative Hegyi index is a variant
which picks competitors based on minimum distance of neighbouring trees
within arc zones around the focal tree.
